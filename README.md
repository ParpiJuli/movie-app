# Getting Started with Movie App

This project was developed by Julieta Parpinelli using ReactJS, Tailwind, Styled-Components, React Router and Yarn, as package manager.

Api used is [The Movie DB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/genres/get-movie-list)

## Project Description

This project is an app that shows users information about films. When starting the app, the user will see a Home Page that displays popular films. Users may filter movies by name or by release year. Users may also see lists of films related to certain genres. When clicking on a movie card, user will be redirected to Movie Details Page. On that same page, films related to the same genre will be offered to the user.

Also, there is a Storybook Page that displays some of the main components used.
